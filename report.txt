This is my fork for IT-Jim trainee program. 

The main goal was to detect and recognize faces.

The time that was left wasn't enough to complete this task properly, because the main focus was on NLP task, so I have trained my model poorly and saved it in siamesemodel.h5.  

The solution consists of 3 files:

SNN.ipynb - SNN model code ( was created using open-source tutorials )
main.py - OpenCV lib was used to detect a face and make a frame around it but I couldn't manage to run SNN model due to the reasons that was mentioned above.
siamesemodel.h5 - SNN model
